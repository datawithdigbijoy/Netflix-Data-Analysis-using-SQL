## Overview
**Database**: `Netflix_Data`
In this project, SQL is used to perform a detailed analysis of Netflix’s movies and TV shows dataset to gain insights and solve business questions. The README outlines the project’s goals, challenges, analytical methods, insights, and final conclusions.


## Objectives
This project aims to analyze the distribution of content types—movies and TV shows—while identifying the most common ratings for each category. It also involves examining content trends based on release years, countries, and durations, as well as exploring and categorizing titles according to specific criteria and keywords.

## SCHEMAS of Netflix

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS netflix;
CREATE TABLE netflix
(
    show_id      VARCHAR(5),
    type         VARCHAR(10),
    title        VARCHAR(250),
    director     VARCHAR(550),
    casts        VARCHAR(1050),
    country      VARCHAR(550),
    date_added   VARCHAR(55),
    release_year INT,
    rating       VARCHAR(15),
    duration     VARCHAR(15),
    listed_in    VARCHAR(250),
    description  VARCHAR(550)
);
```

## Business Problems and Solutions

### 1. Count the Number of Movies vs TV Shows

```sql
SELECT 
    type,
    COUNT(*)
FROM netflix
GROUP BY 1;
```

### 2. Find the Most Common Rating for Movies and TV Shows

```sql
WITH RatingCounts AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        COUNT(*) AS rating_count
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY type, rating
),
RankedRatings AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        rating_count,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY rating_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM RatingCounts
)
SELECT 
    type,
    rating AS most_frequent_rating
FROM RankedRatings
WHERE rank = 1;
```
### 3. List All Movies Released in a Specific Year (e.g., 2020)

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM netflix
WHERE release_year = 2020;
```
### 4. Find the Top 5 Countries with the Most Content on Netflix

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM
(
    SELECT 
        UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country, ',')) AS country,
        COUNT(*) AS total_content
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY 1
) AS t1
WHERE country IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY total_content DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 5. Identify the Longest Movie

```sql
SELECT 
    *
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1)::INT DESC;
```

### 6. Find Content Added in the Last 5 Years

```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix
WHERE TO_DATE(date_added, 'Month DD, YYYY') >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '5 years';
```

### 7. Find All Movies/TV Shows by Director 'Rajiv Chilaka'

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT 
        *,
        UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(director, ',')) AS director_name
    FROM netflix
) AS t
WHERE director_name = 'Rajiv Chilaka';
```

### 8. List All TV Shows with More Than 5 Seasons

```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'TV Show'
  AND SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1)::INT > 5;
```

```sql
SELECT 
    UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(listed_in, ',')) AS genre,
    COUNT(*) AS total_content
FROM netflix
GROUP BY 1;
```

### 10.Find each year and the average numbers of content release in India on netflix. Return top 5 year with highest avg content release!

```sql
SELECT 
    country,
    release_year,
    COUNT(show_id) AS total_release,
    ROUND(
        COUNT(show_id)::numeric /
        (SELECT COUNT(show_id) FROM netflix WHERE country = 'India')::numeric * 100, 2
    ) AS avg_release
FROM netflix
WHERE country = 'India'
GROUP BY country, release_year
ORDER BY avg_release DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 11. List All Movies that are Documentaries

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM netflix
WHERE listed_in LIKE '%Documentaries';
```

### 12. Find All Content Without a Director

```

### 13. Find How Many Movies Actor 'Salman Khan' Appeared in the Last 10 Years

WHERE casts LIKE '%Salman Khan%'
  AND release_year > EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) - 10;
```
### 14. Find the Top 10 Actors Who Have Appeared in the Highest Number of Movies Produced in India

```sql
SELECT 
    UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(casts, ',')) AS actor,
    COUNT(*)
FROM netflix
WHERE country = 'India'
GROUP BY actor
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
### 15. Categorize Content Based on the Presence of 'Kill' and 'Violence' Keywords

```sql
SELECT

    COUNT(*) AS content_count
FROM (
    SELECT 
        CASE 
            WHEN description ILIKE '%kill%' OR description ILIKE '%violence%' THEN 'Bad'
            ELSE 'Good'
